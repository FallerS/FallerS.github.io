Hi, my name is Sven. My blog mainly serves as an opportunity to present my interest in approaching Asset Management topics quantitatively. 

I am currently working as Portfolio Analyst for an Investment Data Services company and will be attending the CFA level II exam in 2021 (if it's taking place in Germany this year...).
