Hi, my name is Sven. This blog mainly serves as an opportunity to present my interest in approaching Finance / Asset Management topics quantitatively. I will mostly rely on Python for now since I am most confident with it. 

I am currently working as Portfolio Analyst for an Investment Data Management company and I am currently candidate for the CFA charter.
