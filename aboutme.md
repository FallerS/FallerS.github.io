Hi, my name is Sven. This blog mainly serves as an opportunity to present my interest in approaching Asset Management topics quantitatively. 

My posts will strongly rely on Python with some SQL along the way. 
I am currently working as Portfolio Analyst for an Investment Data Services company and will be attending the CFA level II exam in 2021 (if it's taking place in Germany this year...).
