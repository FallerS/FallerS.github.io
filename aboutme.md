Hi, my name is Sven. This blog mainly serves as an opportunity to present my interest in approaching Asset Management topics quantitatively. I will mostly rely on Python for now with some SQL to go along the way. 

I am currently working as Portfolio Analyst for an Investment Data Management company.
