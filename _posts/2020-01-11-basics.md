This first blog post serves as basis for the upcoming posts and topics to get some of the very basics out of the way. Most will be done in Python. There are various sources for Python in gerneral and finance-related topics in specific online, some can be found in the resources of this page.

Most of these basics rely on the online courses by [Edhec Risk Institute](https://risk.edhec.edu/who-we-are) which can be found on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/investment-management-python-machine-learning). I can only recommend taking these courses as most of the content is free to access without payment. 

Let's start with the very basics which we will be using in the following posts on more interesting topics: 
* data and data-source
* packages and basic functions we will be using. 
* Aggregate them in our go-to package for the remainder of the posts

## Data-source

We will be using part of Kenneth R. Frenchs [data library](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html), specifically the [30-industry portfolio](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/det_30_ind_port.html)
